### Notes for learnr tutorials

These tutorials were designed for an introductory statistics class by Russ Poldrack, taught using his "Statistical Thinking" book (available [here](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691218441/statistical-thinking) in paperback; an open source version (largely similar to the published version except for Chapter 17) is available [here](http://statsthinking21.org).

For use in teaching, I hosted them using [shinyapps.io](http://shinyapps.io).
